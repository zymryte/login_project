It's time to build Login and Registration again, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.

Registration should adhere to the following guidelines:

First Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Last Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Email - required; valid format
Password - required; at least 8 characters; matches password confirmation
